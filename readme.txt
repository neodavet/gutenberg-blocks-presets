= Perfect For =

* Agencies managing multiple client sites

= Usage Examples =

In PHP templates: `gbp_render_block_preset(123);` and `do_cpt_block(123)` (legacy support)

In content: `[gbp_block id="123"]` and `[block_preset id="123"]` (legacy)

REST API: `GET /wp-json/gbp/v1/block-presets`, `GET /wp-json/gbp/v1/block-presets/123`, `GET /wp-json/gbp/v1/block-presets/123/render`

You can customize these folders in the plugin settings.
