# Gutenberg Blocks Presets

A free, open-source WordPress plugin to create and manage reusable Gutenberg block presets. Build content once and reuse it anywhere via a native block, PHP helpers, shortcodes, or REST API.

- Plugin URI: https://neodavet.github.io/davetportfolio/
- License: GPL v2 or later
- Requires: WordPress 5.9+, PHP 7.4+

## Key Features
- Native custom post type for presets: `gbp_block_preset`
- Gutenberg block to insert presets (`gbp/block-preset`)
- Shortcodes: `[gbp_block id="123"]` and legacy `[block_preset id="123"]`
- PHP helpers: `gbp_render_block_preset()` and legacy `do_cpt_block()`
- Taxonomies: categories (`gbp_block_category`) and tags (`gbp_block_tag`)
- Usage tracking: local table logs where presets are used
- REST API: list, fetch, and render presets
- Admin UI: Settings, Tools, and Statistics
- Migration tools: from legacy post type `block`
- Optional ACF integration: auto-register ACF blocks from theme folders (only when enabled and ACF Pro is installed)
- Translation-ready and full uninstall cleanup

## Installation
1. Upload `gutenberg-blocks-presets/` to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate “Gutenberg Blocks Presets” in Plugins.
3. Go to Settings → Blocks Presets to configure.
4. Create presets under the “Block Presets” menu and use the block or shortcodes in your content.

## Usage
### Gutenberg Block
- Insert “Block Preset” in the editor
- Use the sidebar to search/filter and select a preset
- Options: show title, custom CSS class, alignment

### PHP
```php
// Recommended
gbp_render_block_preset(123);

// Legacy (still supported)
do_cpt_block(123);
```

### Shortcodes
- `[gbp_block id="123"]` (recommended)
- `[block_preset id="123"]` (legacy)

### REST API
- `GET /wp-json/gbp/v1/block-presets`
- `GET /wp-json/gbp/v1/block-presets/{id}`
- `GET /wp-json/gbp/v1/block-presets/{id}/render`

## Settings Overview
Find these under Settings → Blocks Presets.

- Enable Block Presets: core `gbp_block_preset` functionality
- Enable ACF Blocks (Optional): auto-register ACF blocks from theme folders when ACF Pro is active
- Enable Legacy Post Type: keep legacy `block` post type for backward compatibility during migration
- ACF Block Folders (one per line):
  - `general/acf-blocks`
  - `public/acf-blocks`
  - `login-register/acf-blocks`
  - `members/acf-blocks`

## ACF Integration (Optional)
When enabled and ACF Pro is installed, the plugin can:
- Register ACF blocks from configured theme folders
- Provide a “Custom ACF Blocks” category in the editor
- Load per-block CSS/JS assets if present

If ACF is not installed or ACF features are disabled, the plugin works fully with native WordPress features.

## Migration Guide (from legacy systems)
1. Activate the plugin.
2. Visit Settings → Blocks Presets and verify:
   - Enable Block Presets: ON
   - Enable Legacy Post Type: ON (during migration)
   - Enable ACF Blocks: optional (only if you use ACF Pro)
3. Use Block Presets → Tools to migrate old content if needed.
4. Test:
   - Legacy `do_cpt_block()` calls still work
   - New `gbp_render_block_preset()` and the Gutenberg block
5. After confirming everything works, disable “Enable Legacy Post Type”.

## Troubleshooting
- ACF blocks not appearing:
  - Ensure ACF Pro is active and “Enable ACF Blocks” is ON
  - Verify folders exist and are configured in Settings
- Old blocks not working:
  - Keep “Enable Legacy Post Type” ON during migration
  - Run migration tools in Block Presets → Tools
- Duplicate menus or conflicts:
  - Ensure no theme or other plugin registers the same post types

## Privacy
- The plugin creates a local table tracking preset usage (block ID, post ID, usage count, last used date)
- No personal data is collected by this feature and no data is sent to third parties
- Uninstalling from the Plugins screen removes plugin data (posts, options, tables)
